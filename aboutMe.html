<h1>About me:</h1>
<hr/>
<p>A 19 year old college student pursuing my degree in Computer Science Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology. 
   Currently aiming to master Full Stack Web Development with multiple front-end and back-end languages including API 
   design and Database Management. On the side, I particularly take a keen interest in learning Game Development using 
   Unreal Engine 5. I also prefer taking activities outside of the regular domain or field of interest, some of which
   include sports, video games and music.<br/></p>
   <p>
   Let's highlight a little on my strengths and vulnerabilities. Some of the positive qualities or 
   Strengths I particularly possess is my curious nature and the feeling of wanting to know about something is what
   keeps me really going at times and I can often maintain a calm composure during tense moments. As for my vulnerable
   side, I am generally impatient at things and sometimes I tend to lose temper quickly, I'm also a little sluggish
   when it comes to proper time management but these are something I'm constantly trying to overcome from all the 
   consequences bound by them. That's about it for me.</p>
